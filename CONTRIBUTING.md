## 💻 Code Style Guidelines

- **HTML/CSS**: Keep markup semantic and styles organized
- **Comments**: Add JSDoc comments to functions and complex sections
- **Formatting**: 4-space indentation in JavaScript, consistent style

### Example Comment Style:
```javascript
/**
 * Brief description of what the function does
 * @param {type} paramName - Description of parameter
 * @returns {type} Description of return value
 */
function doSomething(paramName) {
  // Implementation
}
```
